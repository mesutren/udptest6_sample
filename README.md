# Description
This application demonstrates the benefits of using Time-Aware Traffic
Scheduling and LaunchTime to reduce transmission jitter for scheduled traffic as
measured by inter-packet latency. Inter-packet latency measures the time between
packets as they are being transmitted, it reflects how deterministic the
scheduled traffic is being transmitted (within the defined cycle time).

For a more detailed description please refer to Section 5.0 of
[TSN Reference Software User Guide](../doc/README.md).
